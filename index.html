    <h2>What this workshop is about?</h2>
    <p>
        Thaler and Sunstein (2008) defined <span class="r">nudge</span>, as "any aspect of the choice architecture that alters peopleâ€™s 
        behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives." 
        As can be seen from this definition, humans (or decision makers) and organizations (both government and private) 
        are using <span class="em">nudges</span> to influence the behavior of target populations. The central idea was that making small 
        changes to the environment in which citizens take decisions, for example, placing healthy food close to supermarket 
        checkouts, rather than banning junk food may achieve better behavior. Thus <span class="em">nudges</span> are small changes to the 
        environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement. On the other hand, <span class="em">nudging</span> is defined as the 
        "systematic and evidence-based development and implementation of <span class="em">nudges</span> in creating behavior change."  
        AI is becoming big part of <span class="em">nudging</span> and this workshop seek to explore the state of the art in AI based systems 
        and applications of <span class="em">nudging</span>.
