    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        Nudging has been widely used by humans (or decision makers) and organizations (both government and private) 
        to influence the behavior of target populations. The concept of nudging is now being widely used in the 
        digital world, as more and more decisions are being made in the digital world. Examples of digital nudging 
        include sending personalized emails by hospitals or public health officials reminding individuals to take 
        vaccine appointments, text messages by collages to stressed-out students to let them know about counseling 
        services during exam weeks, communicating marketing messages through various digital media by marketing agencies, 
        or designing user interfaces to guide peopleâ€™s behavior in digital choice environments.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The central idea behind the nudging is to make small changes to the environment in which citizens take 
        decisions to achieve better behavior. Thus, nudges are small changes to the environment that are easy and 
        inexpensive to implement. Though the concept of nudging has been popularized recently, humans have been 
        using nudges for a long time, including by the governments, businesses, healthcare, public health, policy, 
        law, economics, politics, insurance, banking and financial systems, and advertising. With increasing 
        availability of big data from many scientific disciplines, artificial intelligence (AI), machine 
        learning (ML), and data science (DS) technologies have vast potential to transform data driven nudging 
        and decision making. This workshop seeks to build a new community around AI for nudging and provide a 
        platform for exploring the state of the art in AI/ML/DS based systems and applications of nudging, and digital nudging.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We invite contributions from researchers of any discipline who are developing AI/ML/DS technologies that impact 
        human behavior based on nudging theory. Apart from algorithmic and systems papers, case studies that shed light 
        on how good nudges at are maximizing a specific outcome, how AI/ML based systems can nudge people to make better 
        decisions, or how industry is developing and/or using nudging technology to influence behavior of consumers are of 
        great interest to this workshop.
    </p>
