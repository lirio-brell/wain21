    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        Nudging has been widely used by humans (or decision makers) and organizations (both government and private) 
        to influence the behavior of target populations. The central idea behind the nudging was to make small changes 
        to the environment in which citizens take decisions to achieve better behavior. Thus, nudges are small changes 
        to the environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement. Though the nudge concept has been popularized 
        recently, humans have been using nudges for a long time, including by governments, businesses, healthcare, 
        public health, policy, law, economics, politics, insurance, banking and financial systems, and advertising. 
        With increasing availability of big data from many scientific disciplines, artificial intelligence (AI), 
        machine learning (ML), and data science (DS) technologies have vast potential to transform data driven 
        nudging and decision making. This workshop seeks build a new community around AI for nudging and provide 
        a platform for exploring the state of the art in AI/ML/DS based systems and applications of nudging, and digital nudging. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We invite innovative contributions from researchers any discipline who are developing AI/ML/DS technologies 
        that impact human behavior based on nudging theory.
